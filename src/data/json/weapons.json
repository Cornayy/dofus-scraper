Only the horrible, pitiless Liche refused to recognise his immense talent. Offended that such a creature wouldn't stand in awe before his creations, he issued an ultimatum, refusing to forge so much as a teaspoon until his sword smith skills received the public recognition they deserved. But he hadn't reckoned on the horrible Liche, who never gave in. A century or so later, the smith had to resign himself to going back to work… even though his skills had gotten rusty. This ridiculous sword was his last usable creation. The years passed by and the sword's true power was finally discovered. If shattered, the sword released an evil energy which would do lasting damage to Liche's economic activities. Mocked, provoked, humiliated, and beaten at her own game, she feigned giving up, only to come back meaner than ever and take her revenge when the time was right.","imageUrl":"https://static.ankama.com/dofus/ng/img/../../../dofus/www/game/items/200/6051.png","encyclopediaUrl":"/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/weapons/7102-ice-knight-sword","level":20,"stats":["11 to 15 (HP restored)","16 to 20 Vitality","11 to 15 Intelligence","2 Lock","5 Heals"],"conditions":["AP: 2 (2 uses per turn)","Range: 1","CH: 1/30 (+5)"]},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2d416d8a27cb1eec66f608"},"type":"Hammer","name":"Ivory Hammer","description":"This hammer increases its bearer's intelligence.","imageUrl":"https://static.ankama.com/dofus/ng/img/../../../dofus/www/game/items/200/7003.png","encyclopediaUrl":"/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/weapons/230-ivory-hammer","level":19,"stats":["10 to 14 (Fire damage)","21 to 30 Vitality","2 to 3 Critical Resistance","2 to 3 Dodge","2 Neutral Damage","2 Critical Damage"],"conditions":["AP: 4 (1 use per turn)","Range: 1","CH: 1/30 (+5)","Intelligence \u003e 10"]},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2d416e8a27cb1eec66f609"},"type":"Bow","name":"Disconcerting Bow","description":"The Disconcerting Bow is not new by any means, but it can be very useful.","imageUrl":"https://static.ankama.com/dofus/ng/img/../../../dofus/www/game/items/200/2003.png","encyclopediaUrl":"/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/weapons/267-disconcerting-bow","level":19,"stats":["5 to 7 (Water damage)","16 to 20 Vitality","11 to 15 Chance","4 to 5 Wisdom","2 to 3 Prospecting"],"conditions":["AP: 3 (1 use per turn)","Range: 2 to 6","CH: 1/30 (+10)","Chance \u003e 19"]},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2d416f8a27cb1eec66f60a"},"type":"Shovel","name":"Scratchy Shovel","description":"An extremely well-forged shovel, this tool will make a worthy adversary of you.","imageUrl":"https://static.ankama.com/dofus/ng/img/../../../dofus/www/game/items/200/8005.png","encyclopediaUrl":"/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/weapons/247-scratchy-shovel","level":19,"stats":["11 to 15 (Neutral damage)","11 to 15 Vitality","11 to 15 Agility","11 to 15 Chance"],"conditions":["AP: 4 (1 use per turn)","Range: 1","CH: 1/30 (+5)"]},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f2d416f8a27cb1eec66f60b"},"type":"Sword","name":"Slash","description":"This strange double-bladed sword was originally used to prune trees and cut through dense forests.
